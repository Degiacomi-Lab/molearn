# TRAINING EXAMPLES

This folder contains example scripts demonstrating the usage of *molearn*.

## Dataset
The file `Murd_test.pdb` is an abridged version of the MD trajectory of the MurD protein described in *molearn*'s main publication (see main page of Github repo).
It can be used to verify that *molearn*'s code is running as intended.

## Training protocols

* `bb_foldingnet_basic.py`: minimal example demonstrating how to load data, setup foldingnet, and train it

More examples will follow.

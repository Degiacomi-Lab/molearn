abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The assembly of individual proteins into functional complexes is fundamental to nearly all biological processes. In recent decades, many thousands of homomeric and heteromeric protein complex structures have been determined, greatly improving our understanding of the fundamental principles that control symmetric and asymmetric quaternary structure organization. Furthermore, our conception of protein complexes has moved beyond static representations to include dynamic aspects of quaternary structure, including conformational changes upon binding, multistep ordered assembly pathways, and structural fluctuations occurring within fully assembled complexes. Finally, major advances have been made in our understanding of protein complex evolution, both in reconstructing evolutionary histories of specific complexes and in elucidating general mechanisms that explain how quaternary structure tends to evolve. The evolution of quaternary structure occurs via changes in self-assembly state or through the gain or loss of protein subunits, and these processes can be driven by both adaptive and nonadaptive influences.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} In 1972, Anfinsen won a Nobel prize for demonstrating a connection between a protein's amino acid sequence and its three-dimensional structure. Since 1994, scientists have competed in the biannual Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) protein-folding challenge. Deep learning methods took center stage at CASP14, with DeepMind's Alphafold2 achieving remarkable accuracy. Baek {\textless}italic{\textgreater}et al{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} . explored network architectures based on the DeepMind framework. They used a three-track network to process sequence, distance, and coordinate information simultaneously and achieved accuracies approaching those of DeepMind. The method, RoseTTA fold, can solve challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy modeling problems and generate accurate models of protein-protein complexes. —VV {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort {\textless}sup{\textgreater}1–4{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined {\textless}sup{\textgreater}5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences {\textless}sup{\textgreater}6,7{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem' {\textless}sup{\textgreater}8{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years {\textless}sup{\textgreater}9{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} . Despite recent progress {\textless}sup{\textgreater}10–14{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) {\textless}sup{\textgreater}15{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
